    <h1>The one Where my Years of Bilingual Learning Didn't Help me:
</h1>
    <p>As I have said I went to a private elementary school and it was focused on multicultural learning. So we always had learned a lot of spanish from the time we were in kindergarten to fifth grade. I was pretty good because as everyone knows children are said to be sponges. They had signs everything all in spanish to encourage us to learn but not force us. It really worked I knew my stuff when I went to middle school and proceeded to learn a lot more. When I got to high school I switched to German so I still have that spanish bits in my head but it's not super strong. I know the premise though. As most people know the city is notorious for cat calling. Usually I plug my headphones in and pretend like the people on the street aren't saying anything to me. But on this day I had no headphones, they were broken, and I was meeting friends so it didn't really matter I could read on the train. So I was walking down my block and there were some construction workers. I mean, I should have guessed they would have said something honestly. I was still not super conditioned to actually hearing what people said. Usually I noticed when  guys followed me with their eyes. I usually just acted like they liked my outfit in a platonic way or something and totally weren't degrading me because I mean reacting to it can only make it worse and I am not confident enough to make it better. So I am walking down my block and the construction worker says something like</p>
    <p>"ella es una seis" Which roughly translates to </p>
<p>"She is a six" meanwhile I am staring at the guy who said that, in his eyes. He literally was rating me as I was walking. He put me on a scale. I was so shocked my face twisted and he clearly knew I understood him. I was not hurt by his opinion I just started laughing. I mean on a bad day maybe I'm a high four low five but I was going to brunch I was at least an eight. In the end I decided he was definitely putting me on a scale of 1-5 because my outfit was rocking, I was rocking, and no one could ever convince me otherwise. </p>
