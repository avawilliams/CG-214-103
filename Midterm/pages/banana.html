    <h1>The one Where I Explain Why Yellow Fruit Makes me ill:</h1>
    
    <p>
People can not eat bananas around me. It's a fact that my close friends know but not everyone has this knowledge. A lot of people just know that I get sick and probably think I'm a freak. I may be a freak but I don't just hate bananas for no reason. A lot of the time when a banana is around me I start gagging and feel sick to my stomach and a lot of people like testing this theory and that's how once I was hardcore dry heaving out the window of my friends car. So this is what happened because everyone should know that this is real. 
When I was six I loved bananas like most children. My parents fed them to me a lot they actually told me that I would request to have bananas daily which only makes me cringe and feel ill now but whatever that was the old me. I was crazy back then. But one night I was sitting on my dad's lap and I was eating a banana and he was sitting by the fire in the livingroom my brother was playing with my sister. He had the banana in his hand and he was watching the fire since a log had shifted and while he did this I took the liberty of taking an enormous bite of the banana and just swallow it. I obviously started to choke, on the huge chunk of banana that was stuck  halfway down my throat and suddenly I couldn't breathe. My dad tried to help me but he couldn't get it out of me and got up quickly and he dialed 9-1 as he did the heimlich maneuver on me and was almost going to hit the second 1 when I threw it up and was coughing profusely. To this day I refuse to eat bananas and recently while eating ben and Jerry's in rockefeller I got a taste of banana from left over taste of chunky monkey and started to sweat and gag and had to immediately throw away my five dollar ice cream. I contemplated suing Jimmy Fallon mostly because it was the tonight dough I was eating and really who else could I blame? But decided against it when the fire in my heart died down and got americone dream from the store on the way home.
