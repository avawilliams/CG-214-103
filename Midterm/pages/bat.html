        <h1>That one Time There was a Bat flying Around and I Totally Went Every man for Themselves:</h1>
        
        <p>
        In a fight or flight situation I am always flight. Keep that in mind. So one summer evening when my sister and I were in her room it was around 3 in the morning we were up late totally throwing our sleep schedule off and I was reading. I was reading in her bed when suddenly I heard a weird nose and then my sister bolted out of the room leaving me behind. I looked up and there it was. A bat. It was flopping up against the wall and so as quick as I have ever moved I bolted from the bed and closed the door behind me. We of course got our and Dad woke him up. He asked us if it was a moth. Last time I checked there is not a type of moth 700%  bigger than all the others in the suburban area of Connecticut. So my dad said he'll check in the morning. It was on his part only three hours later when he was going to golf so we agreed and my sister and I slept in my room that night. So when my sister and I woke up the next morning of course my dad left the door wide open telling us he "couldn't find it" so of course in my dad's eyes that must mean it's gone. I wasn't so sure about that one. So we close the door on the spot and live the rest of the day in fear. </p>
        <p>That night my sister went and saw the new Batman movie coincidentally, and my mom and I picked her up and we get home get back into the swing of things, night has fallen. My mom is folding clothes on the couch, my sister is sitting in a chair on her phone, and I am on my family computer. I am calm and fine until suddenly there is a scream from my sister. The bat is back. I watch as it flies low towards my sister, my sister screams getting up and running through the kitchen to the dining room and to the door. My mom clearly startled as well she yells, and as it starts flying towards her she walks backwards. The bat turns from my mother's hard stare, and is now eye level with me. Flying directly towards me. Like I said, fight or flight, I was immediately in flight mode. As I was springing up my mother who has still been walking backwards while my sister ran through the dining room, tripped on the stairs and started falling backwards. My mom was about 3 feet from me and instead of helping her get up, I jumped over her and went every man for themselves sprinting out the front door of my house while this bat took over. I felt terrible, here my mother has given me life and my first reaction is to let the bat take her. So I go back for her helping her up and taking her outside. My mom sister and I start laughing beyond compare and my dad sprints downstairs and we tell him the bat was in fact NOT gone and he tries to find it. Low and behold as he's opening the windows to get it to fly out it is right next to him. My dad runs out of the house we of course make him go back in. He grabs a lacrosse stick and picks it up and let's it go to be free in the wild once more. My mom still brings up my ultimate betrayal to her when ever she needs me to do something.
