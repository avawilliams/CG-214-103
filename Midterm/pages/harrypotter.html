    <h1>The one Where Harry Potter was in Front of Me and he Really Didn't Want to be my Friend:
</h1>
    
    
    <p>I love Harry Potter. The movies the books all of it, I grew up with it. My brother is six years my senior, it was a common ground amongst us. So these books, these movies were something that connected not only us siblings but my whole family. Every time a new book came out my grandmother would buy us the copy and we'd all read it together. My mom would read it to us while my brother would read it on his way to school. So even as an adult now we watch all the movies, I've reread the books, and I've been to harry potter world the whole lot of it. This past semester on Tuesdays I had class from 9am-9:30pm and so I was constantly at FIT for that whole day. We got an hour break in one of my classes so I went to Dunkin Donuts because it was the week I was getting paid so I was balling on a budget. I was shoveling a bagel into my mouth it was election day, admittedly was excited that a women would be winning... regardless. A voting center was located at FIT and so there were loads of people. I was walking back to class and I look up and make eye contact with him. Daniel Radcliffe, he was standing 3 feet at most from me. I stopped and he looked into my soul and saw the flame that burned inside of me and proceeded to immediately turn around. Daniel Radcliffe is one of those celebrities where you know it's him. Despite how much he tries to hide I knew it was him even just from the back of his head. I didn't get out my phone because I didn't want to bother him and make him think I was going to flip. I was a New Yorker now I wasn't going to freak over a celebrity. So I am literally walking next to Daniel Radcliffe and I am just laughing. I couldn't help it I couldn't believe it. I was just dying of laughter and when he got to FIT we parted and he watched me go inside. I immediately texted my mom and sister and they flipped. They were for starters angry I didn't ask for an autograph but what was he going to sign my dunkin donuts bag? Also I mean c'mon I wasn't going to go up to him after he literally looked like he wanted to die the moment I recognized him. My mom makes me go back outside, I'm talking she said and I quote, </p>
<p>"Do not come home if you don't take a picture to prove it was him." After telling everyone in my class and all the professors I have ever had that were in the area around me I grabbed my phone and headed outside with Olivia. I think Olivia was a little skeptical but I saw him and his bright blue hat with his girlfriend who was the one voting clearly. Olivia only saw the back of his head and said</p>
<p>"Oh yeah that's him." There is no hiding for this guy. He finally came out, waiting for his girl and I took a picture of him as slyly as I could and when he left I took another. Though I only made eye contact with him. It was enough for my childhood to be complete.
