    <h1>The one Where my Breakfast Lead to a new Discovery About me:</h1>
    <p>
    The one thing you can count on my best friend's mom in doing, is making waffles in the morning. It's a right as a human being that if you stay the night waffles shall be made for you in celebration of a successful sleepover. The morning I had stayed was no different. My mom had come to get us and I was waiting for my sister. My mom came rather early though and so I had to eat the waffle I was given rather quickly to make up for the fact that we were leaving in five minutes. So fresh off the press, a waffle is handed over to me and I start eating it. I am about five bites in and despite the burn that I feel I keep going. But I get one of those moments where the bite I took is going down really slowly and let me tell you, that was like eating magma. I was trying to play it cool I was squinting a bit and gripping the counter so tightly my knuckles were white. It hurt so bad that I couldn't even process my mom and my best friends mom talking about my college plans. All I knew was, that I had just eaten something as hot as the center of the earth, and my throat felt like it was disintegrating as the bite went down about as quick as the 47th sloth in a line of sloths, with each sloth going slower than the last. I was playing it as cool as I could despite being on fire and finally when the bite went down all the way I stood up straight and sighed. Then it went black

    I woke up on the floor my eye hurt and I couldn't hear for a hot second. When I really came too I was on the ground my mom was yelling</p>
    <p>"Ava say something" a thousand times over and over and over again. I was sweaty and I looked at everyone not knowing what I had just done. I can only imagine this feeling is the same feeling the Hulk gets after calming down but that's just me. </p>
    <p>"What happened?" Apparently I fainted and since all the blood rushed to my head I couldn't hear very well. My mom has never broken so many laws at once driving me to the doctor's office. All the while I was trying to tell her I was fine. I had a mini black eye from banging my eye on the corner of the cabinet but regardless I was fine at least I thought so. We get to the doctors rushed in and I explain to my doctor what happened. Apparently I twitched weird which made it look like I was having a seizure. Regardless my doctor says and I quote</p>
   <p>"You fainted because of the waffle." My mom and I could not believe it. He proceeded to explain that basically the heat had triggered a nerve in my throat that slowed my heartrate down and my body thought I was dying because the blood had pooled in my lower body so as a reaction it made me faint. It's the same as when you're asleep and jerk awake only I was standing. So I'm prone to fainting and I can't eat anything too hot or cold or I will faint. My mom and I died of laughter in the doctor's face. We couldn't believe it. That was the reason, a waffle had almost seriously harmed me. Currently surviving with this means I haven't had a hot pocket since that day in fear that I will again faint.
