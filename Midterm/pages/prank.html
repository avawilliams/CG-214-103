    <h1 id="heading">The one Where There was a Prank on Prank:</h1>
        
        <p>Everyone always asks twins if they have ever switched places. For me I can say I have. It was for a school project that we totally turned into a senior prank of sorts. When I was a senior we took a class that wrote the school newspaper so my sister and I pitched the idea that originally was just, let's be each other for the day see what it's like to be the opposite twin. Quickly it spun off to let's switch places and tell none of our teachers. It was a fun prank and my high school was very prank friendly I mean to an extent, like when my uncle put an entire nativity scene at the top of the school with tons of christmas trees and lights they weren't so keen but this was harmless. We did the whole lot of it, including my sister doing my bun like she would and a nail polish sparkle to mock a nose ring. Everything was perfect, so much so the moment we went to the class the switch was for, the teacher that knew we were doing it was tricked. It was practically perfect in every way. The whole school knew it was happening and the teachers had no clue what was going on. We were a college prep campus so we had Day one Day two which meant our classes were 84 minutes each, four classes a day. My teachers were all loving it when we told them (minus one who literally tore me apart for switching even if the only thing we did in class was turn homework in and then start the other homework). My teachers thought it was funny not only because it was a playful and for a project plus I can wholeheartedly say I have never done anything wrong in that school. I have never even had a lunch detention for gosh sakes. Harmless is an understatement, my sister and I were the definition of good noodles.  Regardless we get to the second day and the only problem with this day was that the first class was with a teacher that my sister and I had known our whole lives practically. I'm talking for years we had pizza friday together at his house. He was our neighbor and so we weren't super convinced we could do it. However we were going to try. So I get there and it's the class that runs the morning news announcement so of course I was going to be the one that read to the entire school that </p>
        <p>"This is your day one morning show, I'm Chloe Williams, and here are your announcements." </p>
        <p>So I get to the whole thing and my Neighbor is being really hard on me as I practiced reading he was being professional. He was making me read as best as I could, like I was announcing the name of the child Prince William and Kate Middleton had without telling all of England including the Queen. So I do the whole thing and mind you it was the whole school gathering around the televisions to watch this because it was that big of a prank. So I record everything and once everything is set my teacher/neighbor tells me I have to go up to the attendance office. I go up and everyone in that office is out looking at me. This includes the two vice principals, all school therapists, and the secretaries. The women that does attendance tells me and I quote<p>
        <p>"Ava didn't show up for her first class, she has to attend a saturday morning detention this weekend. Please let her know." My heart stops. For starters this escalated rather quickly. If you skip a class that's not the first thing they jump too. Second I was applying for college this goes on my permanent record. I would never get into Yale. Even if I wasn't applying there that option was out even more than before. Third, where did my sister even go?! Fourth and most important. I am a good noodle I DO NOT DESERVE A SATURDAY MORNING DETENTION. I flip no one says anything to help me. What am I supposed to say</p> 
        <p>"Actually chloe has a detention because we switched places so she will be attending that not me farewell." I should have guessed something was up but I didn't I was just so focused on the fact that I would have to spend an entire saturday with my gym teacher doing homework. I leave and head downstairs. My mother would shame me I was done for. I haven't done anything on this scale before. Course my mom knew I was switching places with my sister but she had been worried we would get in trouble. The whole time I'm thinking of lies to tell my mom why I have to spend 6 hours at school this coming saturday. But as I walk to get my stuff from the room I was in and my neighbor says</p>
        <p>"You really thought, after twelve years, I would have not known the second you walked in that it was you." So surprise it was a prank and I lost seven years from my life because of it.
