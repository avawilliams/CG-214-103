<p>The one About a White Shirt Turned Red and Cheerleading:
 
A little background knowledge will be needed for this story. It's an important one. It's a staple story I break out when I need the mood to be lifted. I've told this story to many professors when they are angry, and many of my friends when they stop laughing at my jokes. It starts like this, I'm from Niantic Connecticut, which is a village around East Lyme. This means I attended East lyme High School. As most people who attended a high school know, when you participate in a sport you compete with the local towns, then there is one big competition then there is states. For East Lyme High School this means our local town competition is called ECC's (Eastern Connecticut Conference). It was my junior year, it was the winter which is the cheerleading competition season. I was named the captain in the fall. This was a big deal, I was a junior and a captain. That didn't happen, it was always seniors. Well there was only one senior that year so I was the captain with her. To say it caused a lot of drama would be an understatement. Of course when you're a cheerleader there is LOADS of drama it's just in the DNA of a cheerleader. So in order to prove to the few people who did not believe in my abilities to be the amazing cheerleader I was, I had to attend ECC all stars. My coach said to my face
"You have to do it, no excuses. PROVE YO SELF." In that exact voice. ECC all stars is essentially something no one should ever want to do or be forced to do. What it is, is the five best cheerleaders from each team that attends ECC's, which there are 14 teams, performing a cheer you learn via youtube in front of 34 judges. All of them being, the coaches from the teams you are competing against. To top it off, you had to do it all alone. Not to say they would be biased, but they would be biased. So I got ready for this thing and I knew I couldn't back out. I had two weeks and in two weeks I stopped eating, I lost sleep, I was stressing out that much. I couldn't do that. At that point I had not been to art school I wasn't used to presenting! I was out of my element as the shyest, quietest cheerleader the world had ever known. Flash forward to the day of the event. I was dressed in a white shirt, bow, and shoes and black shorts like I was specifically instructed to do so. Four really excited cheerleaders, and myself head up to a gym to participate in the world's worst competition. I didnt talk the whole way. I was terrified and so I avoided all eye contact and basically was biting my nails to nubs. My heart beat was like the bass at an EDM festival. The night before I had gotten approximately thirty seconds of sleep and didn't eat so I was also very weak. We get to the gym and we pull up and there are people checking in and my coach met us there and she comes up and visibly can see I am not as excited as the rest. Regardless she pretends I'm okay. I get checked in and we all get a number and so I see that I am number 32, and I am also the first cheerleader going for my town. Wonderful. We all go into the gym and we stretch and about an hour of me mentally screaming constantly we all go to sit. But wait what's this? We all are sitting on the bleachers WATCHING the cheerleaders go up one by one. I'll do the math for you</p>

     <p>14 teams X 5 girls + 34 judges - 1 (the person going) = 103 people watching one person.</p> 

<p>That's not how I like to roll just saying. Especially since cheerleaders can be...judgemental. Not all cheerleaders of course but if you've ever seen Bring it on you should know that that movie wasn't so off with the drama between towns. So now I'm mentally and physically just done for. I hadn't talked since I left that morning and I was really ready to ditch town and never come back. Flash forward I'm standing on the mat nearly dead girl walking. They do this thing in cheerleading where you can not start without someone telling you to start. So you stand out there and you wait for about 30 seconds and they give you about 2 seconds to take a deep breath. I was near blanking on the first words so I wasn't doing so hot and I hadn't even started. I hear the</p>
<p>"You may now begin" so I take in the deep breath and as soon as I let it out, blood, everywhere down my mandatory white shirt. The dry air, the stress, everything had caused a bloody nose in front of a record breaking 103 people judgmental people. Instantly I'm crying. My coach stands up so fast her chair falls backwards and you can hear a gasp go over the crowd. My coach yells as loud as she can as she springs out to me on the mat</p>
<p>"SOMEONE GET HER SOME TOWELS." as if I wasn't embarrassed enough. I walk to the bathroom and my coach instantly feels bad. I'm crying, my nose has been bleeding for 20 minutes, my shirt is now red and she's telling me I don't have to go out and perform. But when my nose finally stops bleeding I figured I have to get over my fears, also nothing could go worse than that introduction so I go dead last with a red shirt on and black out. I couldn't tell you what happened, if I even said anything. I had half the mind to think my coach drugged me to get me to relax. To this day I have no idea what happened. Fast forward two weeks and at the real ECC's they announced the winners of ECC all stars, let's just say I did not get a medal or even a participation award or even recognition for literally having the worst try out of all time which I promise you should be an award.
