    <h1>The one Where my Uber Driver Just Really Didn't Connect With me:</h1>


<p>
    
The worst ever subway line is the F line. I promise. I can wholeheartedly put a list of things that have happened to me that would only ever happen on the F line. Most however are not school friendly so I will not dive into that. However, what also really stinks is that the only subway near my apartment is the F line. Thus I am required to take it. Which it really baffles me how MTA works because for three weekends in February the F was not running at all from 55th street all the way to york street in brooklyn. So basically the entire F line was down. I take the subway on the weekends when I have to work. I work at Urban Outfitters off of times square which on my part was a bad idea but they were hiring. So I couldn't just walk there! Usually I would just walk half an hour to go to the 6 train. But by the time I get out of Urban Outfitters after closing the store it's around midnight and so I'd have to take the 6 I'd get there around 12:30 and get home at 1 in the morning and I was not looking forward to that. So this is where this story begins and now you have the background to understand. I requested an Uber, late one saturday evening. Manhattan was bumping with people going to clubs, Brooklyn was bumping to people going to bars. My uber driver was bumping to his smooth jazz in the front seat I was falling asleep in the back seat practically, headphones in, not talking to my driver besides saying Hi and confirming my name was Ava which everyone always pronounces Eva I've learned to go with it. Everything was going good like a standard Uber. Till he started talking. The talking part was not the part that was a little confusing it was the fact that he was asking me for directions. I was a little concerned and was suddenly and very quickly sending my sister my ETA because I'm not so sure I trust this guy much especially since we've only just met.. My phone was near dead and I start telling this guy where to go but he's not listening to me. He was older I wasn't sure if he just could not hear me or was kidnapping me and pretending he couldn't understand me but I was struggling to understand why this man wasn't using his own directions. Finally in the middle of nowhere this guy just pulls over. For starters, it was not my destination, but this guy made it my destination. He said</p>
<p>"This isn't working you have to get out." It almost sounded like he was practicing a break up to be honest. I laughed really awkwardly because when I get flustered and don't stand up for myself (all the time) that is my only option. I say okay and I get out and he on the spot drives off. So quickly I don't think my door was closed. So he doesn't even wait for me to request a new uber and I've just spent like 11 bucks going from midtown to the soho area. I was nervous because I don't have a clue where I am I just requested another uber as quick as I could. His estimated time of arrival was 2 minutes but it felt like 2 centuries I was waiting. I was freezing my employee badge was tangled in my headphones so I couldn't take it off and use it for self defense if anything happened as it was my only weapon. The road was dark which I didn't know happened in New York but it does and finally my new uber arrived and I was safe. This uber went exactly as planned and I was back home. Now I use lyft.
