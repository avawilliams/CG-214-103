<h1>The one Where I got the Spotlight in the Worst way Possible:</h1>


    <p>In seventh grade no one is an angel. All the girls rocked a middle part and or side bangs, we all had braces and oily skin and we all just wanted no one to ever look at us and stay inside till we turned seventeen. Seventh grade is a year that I should have not been allowed to make my own decisions let’s just say that. In my middle school we had a group of home rooms in one big room. Essentially it was four tiny rooms in one big room. Every two years we got a new assignment to this group of homerooms. So in seventh grade that happened and on the first day we were required to go up and introduce ourselves because not everyone was going to know who you were. A lot of people didn't know who I was mostly because from kindergarten till fifth grade I went to a private elementary school. So I had only been in public school for one year. Our teachers had us sitting in a common area and we all had been going up and introducing ourselves and it was my turn to go up in front of approximately 72 other 7th graders which mind you are ruthless. I'll admit I walked up a little too confidently for someone who thought crimping her hair would be fun to do when she got home. But fake it till you make it. I'm walking up and there it is, the recycling bin full of paper. I acknowledged the recycling because it had strangely a lot of paper in it but I ignored it. I’m going to step over it and my foot catches it and I go down and I mean I go DOWN. I go down exactly like this</p>

<p>The paper falling all over me in front of everyone. I almost wanted to go to the nurse and play sick to go home the moment I made the ten foot journey across the floor. So instead of crying as people laughed I stood up and my teacher told me to just sit down. She didn't even let me do anything which I couldn't tell if it was better that she did that or worse. Good aspect to it, no one knew my name, bad aspect, everyone called me recycle girl since they didn't know who I was. Let's just say, it was a defining fall in my life as I have had many.
