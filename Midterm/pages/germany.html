    <h1>The one Where Germany Tried to Kill me:</h1>
    <p>
    Fresh sixteen year old me had graciously been gifted with the opportunity to attend a school trip to Germany. I was thrilled to be apart of this trip because I was taking German and I got to go out of the Unites States. I never travel, at that point I had been to at most five states my whole life. This was a totally new adventure I was taking on and I was thrilled. But we were staying for ten whole days and I learned a few things. Originally the only problem with me going to Germany was the plane ride since I was terrified. I got over that and despite not sleeping and writing out my will while we had slight wind shaking the plane I was fine. However what I did learn that no one told me was this. 

    
    <ol>
        <li>They don't have still water only sparkling</li>
<li>They have really big portions, and I don't eat a lot anyways</li>
        <li>The waiters will judge you for how little you eat</li>
    </ol>

    So I wasn't doing so hot from the start. I have very weak stomach and I can not eat past being full. If I do I get sick. Also when I eat anything heavy I get sick. Also as hard as I try I can't really eat things that I don't like it makes me sick.I also am really really really really picky. So of course we are eating all traditional German food and of course a 3 course meal. So this is how it usually went. They gave us our drinks then soup, surprise I don't like soup it's so soggy. So as much as I tried to eat the broth sometimes I just couldn't. The waiter would then come grab our stuff and he would look at me like I was insulting him which I probably was. Then we would be given our main course. Which like I said I can not push past full capacity. I would eat an eighth of what the restaurant gave me. The waiter would come back be even more insulted, take my plate last make a scene about it, then dessert would come and sometimes I would eat it sometimes I wouldn't. I don't like cooked fruit or a lot of fruit and usually it was fruity so I gave it to my friends. Then we would leave and the waiter would look at me like I was a stuck up American which I came off that way I do have to admit but my stomach is really sensitive. So that meant the entire trip basically I was getting ill. I thought my stomach would get used to it but it never did. Nights were just terrible for me. I really just can't handle a change. I once drank water from Florida and got sick so honestly It was not the best change on my part. So in the ten days I'll give you a little summary of the stages I went through while Germany tried to kill me.</p>

<p>Day 1: We only had dinner but food didn't settle well. I didn't eat the gross soup we got which was pancake soup which was soggy pancakes in chicken broth essentially. But I got sick for a moment or so then was good to go.</p>
<p>Day 2: Breakfast, you can't go wrong. I totally was fine. Lunch we ate in the hotel. Not my best at dinner I started crying, my stomach hurt so badly that my teacher thought my appendix was bursting. Of course we did nothing about that so I just ate bread.</p>
<p>Day 3: Breakfast good, lunch I was feeling a bit ill but that was a cold I was getting, dinner I was done for. I laid down in our room trying to gain composure and then was good after an hour.</p>
<p>Day 4: So I completely lost my voice, along with the dinner we had was pretty good this one was mac and cheese essentially. But the heaviness in made my stomach feel like it was being pinched almost so I was stuck in the room while everyone got ice cream.</p> 
<p>Day 5: we stayed in a haunted hotel for starters not the best time to boot so I acted like I was okay after dinner to avoid being in my room that night. My stomach probably hated me, it just felt like it was on fire I was done for I should have been doubling over but yeah it just really wasn't working for me.</p>
<p>Day 6: This day was totally cool. We went to Mozart's Geburtshaus (where he was born) in Austria and we got to see all the sights they used for sound of music and frolic through the fields example A:</p>

<p> and so I thought it was really cool I also had the BEST pizza I have ever had in my whole life. So my stomach was sort of cool with me for a second because it thought we were home. Surprise. I went to dinner and then a few hours later I was doubled over in the bathroom sure I was going to be ill. I fell asleep as the sun was rising as my stomach finally settled.</p>
<p>Day 7: At dinner I thought I was dying. I couldn't even eat. I still had a cold so I couldn't breathe through my nose and I stood up and the room was spinning. I walked to my room and laid down. I asked my best friend if I was going to die in Germany. She said no, I wasn't so sure though. I slept it off and avoided it, only to be awoken by my German teacher practically kicking the door down. She got my roommate dinner and not me she sort of was done with me at this point. She really didn't care about me or my stomach anymore. I really had a thought in my ill state that German government was trying to kill me for how little of the food I ate. It was a thought that I deeply considered as I drifted in and out of sleep.</p> 
<p>Day 8: The room no longer was spinning we got to go to this cool place where they served spaghetti and I loved it. My stomach was cool that night.</p>
<p>Day 9: Not so good we had a really really really heavy traditional meal that hurt my stomach so bad that I took a ton of advil. I know I shouldn't have. Not enough to kill me but I had the advil and went to sleep at like 7pm and woke up at 9pm and felt fine. </p>
<p>Day 10: We got to choose between two places for our dinner and our final dinner at that. My friends and I went to McDonalds and it was admittedly the best decision I made. It was the last time since last year that I got McDonalds but my stomach was so thankful. It was the end of all my pain. Who would have thought that McDonalds would save my life one day. 

My German teacher still brings it up to classes I get told. She tells them that, 
"One year a girl got sick every night! Don't do that to me again." Yes, because it was totally my fault.
